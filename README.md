# Re-Overhaul

OpenAI Codex Hackathon, Deep Learning Labs #5, 10-9-21

Re-Overhaul is a web application that utilizes OpenAI Codex and GPT-3 to optimize user submitted code. Users input a block of code, its input language and desired improvements. GPT-3 processes each block of code line by line for further review. Users pick lines of code for increased understanding. Codex reprocesses and updates towards users requests. Users can also translate blocks of code between coding languages.
